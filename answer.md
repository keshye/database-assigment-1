Answers to Questions

## Question 1

Components of a DBMS (Database Management System)

A DBMS consists of several components that work together to manage and provide access to a database. The main components of a DBMS are:

Database Engine: The core component that manages data storage, retrieval, and manipulation.
Query Processor: Interprets and executes SQL queries to retrieve or modify data.
Storage Manager: Manages data storage, including data allocation, deallocation, and storage optimization.
Security Manager: Enforces security policies, including authentication, authorization, and access control.
Transaction Manager: Manages transactions, ensuring atomicity, consistency, isolation, and durability (ACID) properties.
Data Dictionary: Stores metadata about the database, including schema, indexes, and constraints.
User Interface: Provides a way for users to interact with the database, such as command-line interfaces, graphical user interfaces, or application programming interfaces (APIs).

## Question 2
A relational database is a type of database that organizes data into one or more tables, with each table having rows and columns. Each row represents a single record, and each column represents a field or attribute of that record. The relationships between tables are defined using keys, which enable data to be linked and queried across tables.

Examples of Relational Databases

MySQL# 
PostgreSQL
Microsoft SQL Server
Oracle Database
## Question 3
 (Structured Query Language) can be classified into three categories:

DML (Data Manipulation Language): Used to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on data, such as INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE statements.
DDL (Data Definition Language): Used to define the structure of a database, including creating and modifying tables, indexes, and constraints, such as CREATE TABLE and ALTER TABLE statements.
DQL (Data Query Language): Used to retrieve and manipulate data, including SELECT, JOIN, and SUBQUERY statements. 
## Question 4
A Primary Key is a unique identifier for each record in a table, ensuring that each record is distinct and can be referenced by other tables.

A Foreign Key is a field in a table that references the primary key of another table, establishing a relationship between the two tables.
## Question 5
An Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) is a visual representation of a database schema, showing the relationships between entities (tables) and their attributes (columns). ERDs are used to design and model databases, helping to identify entities, attributes, and relationships.
## Question 6
Advantages of Relational Databases

Improved Data Integrity: Relational databases ensure data consistency and accuracy by enforcing constraints and relationships.
Better Data Sharing: Relational databases enable multiple users and applications to access and share data simultaneously.
Enhanced Data Security: Relational databases provide robust security features, including access control and encryption.
Improved Data Retrieval: Relational databases enable fast and efficient data retrieval using SQL queries.
## Question 7
Here are four common data types used to store data in tables:

Integer: Whole numbers, such as 1, 2, or 3.
String: Character strings, such as "hello" or "goodbye".
Date: Dates and timestamps, such as "2022-01-01" or "2022-01-01 12:00:00".
Float: Decimal numbers, such as 3.14 or -0.5.
## Question 8
The primary purpose of a DBMS is to provide a way to store, manage, and retrieve data in a controlled and efficient manner, while ensuring data consistency, integrity, and security. A DBMS enables multiple users and applications to access and share data, and provides features such as data modeling, data normalization, and query optimization to improve data management and retrieval.
